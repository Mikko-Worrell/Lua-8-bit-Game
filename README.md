# Cherry Bomb
Hello! 
This is a retro Shmup (shoot-em up) game I have created using Lua and the fantasy games console Pico-8.

To try out my game feel free to download the relevant executable file (Windows, Mac or Linux), unzip the file and then run it. 

--Controls--
Arrow keys for movement.
x to shoot (hold for rapid fire).
c to use cherrys as ammo:
- cherry shots deal triple damage and destroy enemy bullets that they collide with.
- the more cherries consumed, the more shots are fired.
- collect 10 cherries to gain a life, if 10 cherries are collected at full health you gain bonus score.


Thank you!
